# Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV

## Overview
This project demonstrates **real-time face detection** using Python and OpenCV.  
It utilizes the **Haar Cascade Classifier** to detect faces from a live webcam feed and highlights them with rectangles while displaying status messages dynamically.

---

## Features
- Detect multiple faces in real-time.
- Highlights detected faces with rectangles.
- Shows dynamic status messages:
  - "Face Detected" when one or more faces are found.
  - "No Face Available" when no face is detected.
- Simple and beginner-friendly Python implementation.

---


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
```bash

pip install opencv-python


pip install numpy

How to access 


git clone https://github.com/amandx36/RealTime-Face-Detection-OpenCV

cd FaceDetection 
pip install -r requirements.txt
python liveFaceDetection.py 

now you were good to gooooooooo              !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
